## Future Scope

### 1. Multiplayer Mode

Enhance the game by introducing a multiplayer mode where one player provides the word, and another player tries to guess it. This adds a competitive and interactive element to the Hangman game.

### 2. Multiplayer Support

Implement features to support multiplayer functionality, allowing users to play the game with friends or random opponents. This could involve real-time communication or turn-based gameplay, providing a more engaging experience.

### 3. Score Database

Integrate a database system to store and track players' scores. This could include features such as high scores, achievements, and player statistics. Storing scores would add a competitive aspect and motivation for players to improve.
